			<h2>Growing up in the Lord</h2>
			<h5>Sunday, Febuary 3rd, 2019</h5>

				<p>Serving what God has called us to do <br>
				In Hebrews 5:12, we are told that if we need someone to show us the path to God, then we <br>
				are no better than a child when it comes to knowing our Father. <br>
				From 1 Corinthians 13:11, to grow in God is to put away childish things, to behave as a  <br>
				man, and to think as a grown up and to put away such childish behaviors and thinking. </p>

				<p>What happens when we put up our childish toys? When we do, we don't always grow up. </p>

				<p>We have our physical age, our mental age, and our Heavenly age. If we can't lead someone <br>
				to the faith, we need to grow our faith up more. We need to grow past the John 3:16s of <br>
				the Bible. </p>

				<p>God intends for us to always grow. He will never have a stopping point in our life, no <br>
				point where we stop growing in our faith, in our knowledge, or in our life. He expects <br>
				and wants for us to always keep learning, to keep growing, to continue moving on the path <br>
				He set for us. In both our physical and spiritual lives. </p>

				<p>Just by attending church on Sundays, or knowing John 3:16 from memory makes us a Christian. <br>
				God expects more from us then what we expects of ourself. </p>

				<p>Spiritual growth requires good soil. Our lives must be prepared for spiritual growth in <br>
				order for growth to happen <i>Mark 4:3-8</i>. We have to change if we want to see God's light in <br>
				our lives. </p>

				<p><i>Happy is the man who is always reverent, but he who hardens his heart will fall into calamity. <br>
				Proverbs 28:14</i> </p>

				<p>By tilling the soil of our hearts and accepting Christ into us, we let the <br>
				seed grow and flower, unlike the man who hardens his heart against Christ. Even if a seed is <br>
				furrowed, it will not grow in a harden heart's rocky soil where roots cannot survive. </p>

				<p>A hard heart to the Lord will convince you that change and growth will never happen, just like a seed <br>
				that is sown on rocky soil. Even if seeds in Christ are sown well, without roots in the ground, <br>
				fear, doubt, or any sin will whither the shoots and kill the growth of our faith. If we don't plow the <br>
				soil of our hearts for the Lord, the Word will not take and grow. </p>

				<p><i>Many honour me with their lips, but disvow me in their hearts Matthew 6:5</i> </p>

				<p>Part of growing up is also removing the competition in our hearts to give our everything to God. If <br>
				we don't remove or put to death the thorns and thickets of the worries and desires of our lives, <br>
				we will never grow in Christ. To grow, we must give our lives to Christ. If we allow what we want <br>
				to over shadow what God wants, we choke out the seeds of the Word. </p>

				<p>Grow your faith in the soft soil of your heart but build your relationship with God on a rock hard foundation. </p>

				<h2>And we have known and believed the love that God has for us. God is love, and he who abides in love <br>
				abides in God, and God in him</h2><i>1 John 4:16</i>
