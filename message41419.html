			<h2>Palm Sunday</h2>
			<h5>Sunday, April 14th, 2019</h5>

			<p>	On this the last Sunday of Lent, it is important to remember why we fast in these 40 days.<br>
				One of the greatest stories of His Word, in the book of Joshua, is that of Rahab, the harlot of Jericho.
			</p>

			<p>This harlot first hears of the Isrealites in their journey through the kingdoms saving the sinners and punishing the oppressors.<br>
			As her story progresses, first with the safeguarding the Isreali spies for the Kingdom of our Lord, then in aiding in their escape; all this while
			she held faithful in God that her salvation would come. And with good news, it does, just as all of our peace will come; as we know, the walls of Jericho
			come tumbling down and Rahab and her family are saved forever more.</p>

			<p>Faith is seeing Earth, and knowing there is a Heaven</p>
			<p>Faith is seeing the path ahead of you, and letting God guide your steps</p>
			<p>Faith is knowing you will have trials, and knowing that God has your peace.</p>

			<p>Faith is important to us people of God because without it, we will lose our way and become wandering sheep out of the fold. Sadly, it is easy to lose our
			way; whether it is from letting our tongue get the better of us (James 1:26) or our heart being hardened from His love, we must have faith that He is always
			watching out for us.</p>

			<p>Faith is not speaking</p>
			<p>Faith is not doubting</p>
			<p>Faith is remembering who we are in His eyes for He knew us before we were born (Jeremiah 1:5)</p>

			<p>The importance of remembering Him, and building our connection with Him, can be found with deeper inspection in the Book of Joshua still in chapter 6, verse 10. When
			Joshua commands the Army of Isreal to march in silence until the 7 day, after the 7 ram's horn trumpets cried for the 7th time, after the 7th round around the city of Jericho,
			because it is in those 6 days before the fall of the walls of Jericho that the works of the Lord had weakened them. It is in silence and respect and praise of Him, that He
			does the most kind work unto us. If we constatnly run our mouths, we leave no room for Him, or the praise He deserves for all of the blessings He has given us in our lives.</p>

			<p>That is not saying however that all praise to Him goes without noise, for the greatest praise of all to Him is in our lifting of voices and shouting our thanksgiving to Him.<br>
			These things we are told by reading His Word, which is Him, and in reading, we find Him. And through Him, we find peace and thanksgiving, great is our Lord God!</p>

			<p>These last days of Lent are perhaps the most important, the Thursday before Easter, Maundy Thursday, is the Feast of the Eucharist in which Jesus gave his disciples the commandment
			to love one and other as He loved them. Maundy Thursday is also the Last Supper before Jesus' crucifixion in which He died for our sins and rose again; conquering the grave and giving
			sinners, gentiles, and all the gift of Eternal life through Him and the power of the Holy Spirit with God the Father.</p>

			<p>Faith is seeing reality and knowing there is Eternity</p>

			<i>"the eyes of your understanding being enlightened; that you may know what is the hope of His calling, what are the riches of the glory of His inheritance in the Saints</i>
			<i>and what is the exceeding greatness of His power toward us who believe, according to the working of His mighty power"</i>
			<h2>~ Ephesians 1:18 - 19</h2>
