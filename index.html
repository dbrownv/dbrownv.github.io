			<h2>About Me</h2>
			<img src="IMG_1882.png" width="128" height="128">
			<p>My name is David C Brown V, and I am a 6th generation Floridian. It's been a passion of mine working with horses and furthering my ranch work knowledge.</p>
			<p>I am a 4th generation Gator and am studying Equine Science through the College of Agriculture and Life Sciences/Institute of Food and Agricultural Sciences at the University of Florida.</p>
			<p>After graduation I plan on working full time for a ranch Iâ€™ve been cowboying at over the past summers. Though at some point I would like to breed American Quarter Horses and Florida Cracker Horses.</p>

			<h3>Riding for the Lord</h3>
			<h5>Tuesday, January 29th, 2019</h5>
			<p class="solid">Sometimes we come to a path in the road where we can do what we want to do, or we can do what is right and our Father wants us to do. In this modern day and age, we often chose to be a wolf, to stand out in the crowd of "sheep". But if we follow th Word, He makes us stand out, even as we are His sheep by doing what is right and just in His name. It is much harder to be a good Christian, to know and agknowledge our wrong doings when we try to please people instead of bowing our heads and praying for forgiveness or for peace and joy, or even for help. Sometimes the hardest thing to do is to ask our Father for help even when we think we don't deserve it. But we do, we desreve all of His love and help and peace all because He gave His only son to take our sins and give the life He deserved to us, because we are His people and He would give His all for our happiness in all of our days.</p>
