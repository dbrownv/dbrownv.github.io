		<h2>The Hoolihan Archived</h2>
			
		<h3>Starting the Brand</h3>
		<p>It's not always easy following your dreams, but after working out west in New Mexico these past 3 summers, I've finally come to realise what I need to do to be happy.</p>
		<p>Starting with designing and registering my personal brand, the Horned V. Everyone has something that means something to them, and to me, one of the most defining things
			in my life is being the 5th in my name. So that had to be incorporated into my brand. The other defining part of my life was working as a seasonal wrangler on a horse and cow
			calf operation in the little town of Cimarron, New Mexico, Philmont Scout Ranch. And what better way to embrace the western heritage of that area than with a pair of cattle horns?
			And so, the birth of the Horned V came about on November 30th, 2018 when I became a registered brand owner through my home-state of Florida.
